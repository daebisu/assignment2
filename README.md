### Which areas of Manhattan had the largest number of 311 noise complaints? What are some reasons you can think of for these trends?

Upper West Side and Lower West Side have the largest number of 311 noise complaints. I can speculate these areas have ongoing development work in these areas, thus more noise complaints can be heard. Additionally, there could be less enforcement of noise. I noticed the west side of Manhattan has substantially more complaints than towards the East side. There is a bit of selection bias as certain people might be more inclined to call 311 when they usually expect the area to be quieter. 


### What are some trends you noticed regarding the descriptor for noise complaints?

One thing I noticed was how although Construction can be its standalone category, it was still split into categories like Construction Equipment, Contstruction Before/After Hours, and Jackhammering. It shows how these have been complained about so much that they themselves could be standalone categories.

### How did the additional data and map changed or reinforced your insights from Q(1)?

I wanted to see if there was a correlation between a large amount of party noise complaints with an increase in positive COVID tests. In the additional data I used, it was surprising how there were a lower amount of positive tests from the SoHo/Tribeca area compared to the 311 complaint representation map.
